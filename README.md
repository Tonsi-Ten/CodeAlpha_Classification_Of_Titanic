Titanic Classification

This project focuses on classifying Titanic passengers based on their survival status using machine learning. The dataset includes passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and embarkation point.

The data undergoes preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features. A Random Forest Classifier is trained to predict survival, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score.

To use this project, open the Jupyter Notebook, run all cells, and analyze the results. The findings highlight key factors influencing survival during the Titanic disaster.

Ensure that Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn are installed before running the project.
